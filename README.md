# Echo Code Detective

## Vision

Echo Code Detective lets anyone generate and play unique detective games where players are truly free to question AI-driven characters. Unlike traditional scripted games, every investigation is dynamic and player-driven for true immersion.

## Problem Solved

Most mystery games are too scripted, limiting player freedom and replayability. Echo Code Detective empowers everyone to create and experience unscripted, AI-powered investigationsâ€”no coding or art skills required.

## Features

- **Prompt-based Generation:** Instantly create a full investigation (story, suspects, clues, and visual assets) from a simple text prompt.
- **AI Characters:** Each character has a unique personality, secrets, and knowledge. Players can freely interrogate them with natural language.
- **Dynamic Clues & Visuals:** The app generates clues and backgrounds as images, making each case visually unique.
- **Immersive Gameplay:** Explore, question, and accuse suspects in a living, unscripted world.

## Architecture

    api/                # API calls (e.g. Gemini, Supabase)
    components/         # React UI components (game, prompt, scene, UI, etc.)
    context/            # React context providers (game state, etc.)
    data/               # Static or mock data
    hooks/              # Custom React hooks
    integrations/       # External services (supabase, etc.)
    lib/                # Utility libraries
    pages/              # Main app pages (routing)

- **Frontend:** All logic is in `src/` (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend:** Supabase (database, auth)
- **AI:** Gemini API (text), Cloudinary (image upload)

3. **Configure environment variables:** 
### (To make things easier for you in the context of the hackathon, API keys are hard-coded, but they will be revoked after the evaluation period.)
   - Create a `.env` file if needed for API keys (Gemini, Supabase, Cloudinary, etc.)
   - Example:
     ```env
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
     VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=...
     VITE_CLOUDINARY_PRESET=...
     ```
4. **Start the development server:**
